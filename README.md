# Homework Setup

## Main stuff
There are two main files, the HW1_hand.pdf and HW1_code.pdf with the 
hand written and coded parts, respectively.

## Secondary Stuff
All the text files are the tables that are output by the codes. I tried 
to make the names as understandable as possible, but they are also 
referenced and printed in the appendices of the code part.
